1.when there is no runtime error.
Try----> finally----> Continue program execution

2.when there is runtime error.
Try----> catch()----> finally----> Continue program execution

3.When error is occurred but there is no corresponding catch block.
Try----> finally----> Stops program execution by throwing exception object in console.

4.When error is occurred and there is corresponding catch block.
Try----> catch()----> finally----> Continue program execution

If there are n number of exception in try block, as soon as 1st one is
encountered no matter the next once will not be executed.

		int a=10,b=0;
		try {
			String str = "hai";
			str.charAt(8);  // Exception:IndexOutOfRange
			int c=a/b;      // Arithmetic Exception: divide by zero
		}
		
		catch (StringIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
			System.out.println("Inside the string index out of bounds exception block...");
		} 
		
		catch (ArithmeticException e) {
			System.out.println("Inside the arithmetic exception block...");
		}
		
		finally {
			System.out.println("Inside the finally block ...");
		}
		System.out.println("After the finally block...");
		
OUTPUT :  Inside the string index out of bounds exception block...
		  Inside the finally block...
