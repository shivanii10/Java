COLLECTIONS
-represents group of elements as one group.
-It represents dynamic objects.
-provides predefined methods to work on.

Collection Framework
-set of Interfaces, its implementation classes and algorithms

1.List
-Linear structure
-null values allowed
-insertion order is maintained
-can have duplicate values
-elements can be accessed linearly or randomly. 
 

2.Set
2.1.HashSet
-Random order of elements
-insertion order NOT is maintained
-CANNOT have duplicate values
-Null values can only be once 

-Why can't have duplicate values?
HashSet --> uses HashFunction
It uses hash function for memory address allocation

2.2.LinkedHashSet --> all properties same as above
- Only insertion order is maintained

2.3.TreeSet --> all properties same as above
- Elements gets sorted

3.Queue
-Linear structure
-null values allowed
-insertion order is maintained
-can have duplicate values
-elements can be accessed linearly or randomly. 

3.1.Priority Queue
-Sorts elements

3.2.Deque (Double Ended Queue)
-Insertions and Deletions can be done at start and end.
-Deletion can be done based on specific condition

Map
-Two dimensional Object.
-Stores data in form of (Key,Value) pair.
-It is not a sub-class Of collections as it has different properties.
-Keys cannot be duplicated but values can be duplicated.
